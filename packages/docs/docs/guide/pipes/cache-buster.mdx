# Cache Buster

The `cacheBuster` plugin is an essential tool for ensuring that assets are correctly updated when they change.
When the `cacheBuster` plugin is added to the AssetPack configuration file, it generates unique hashes and appends them to file names.
This process ensures that when assets are modified, the updated versions are correctly re-downloaded by the user's browser, bypassing any cached versions.

## Example

<ImageToggle image={'cache/cache-buster'} height={350} />

To use the `cacheBuster` plugin, include it in your AssetPack pipeline.
It's crucial to note that the order of plugins in the pipeline affects the final output. For optimal results,
ensure that the `cacheBuster` transformation occurs at the correct stage in your pipeline.

```ts
// assetpack.config.ts
import { cacheBuster } from "@assetpack/core";

export default {
  ...
  pipes: {
    ...
    // make sure these pipes are added after plugins that generate files
    cacheBuster(),
  },
};
```

## Spine and Texture Packer

When integrating with the [`texturePacker`](/docs/guide/pipes/texture-packer) plugin or your porject has spine atlas files,
you need to add the `texturePackerCacheBuster` / `spineAtlasCacheBuster` pipes immediately after the `cacheBuster` pipe.

The `texturePackerCacheBuster` ensures that the JSON files internally update their asset names to reflect the newly hashed file names.
The `spineAtlasCacheBuster` pipe performs a similar function for spine atlas files.

### Example

```ts
// assetpack.config.ts
import { cacheBuster, texturePackerCacheBuster, spineAtlasCacheBuster } from "@assetpack/core";

export default {
  ...
  pipes: {
    ...
    // make sure these pipes are added after plugins that generate files
    cacheBuster(),
    texturePackerCacheBuster(),
    spineAtlasCacheBuster(),
  },
};
```
