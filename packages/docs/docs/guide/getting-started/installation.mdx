## Overview

AssetPack is a tool for optimising assets for the web. It can be used to transform, combine, compress assets.
Any asset that you want to transform or optimise into something else can be done with AssetPack.

AssetPack is framework agnostic, and can be used with any framework you like, such as PixiJS, Threejs, Phaser, etc.
It uses a plugin based system to allow you to create your own plugins to do whatever you want with your assets.

## Installation

To install AssetPack, you need to install the `@assetpack/core` package.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @assetpack/core
```

:::info COMPATIBILITY NOTE
AssetPack requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 20+, please upgrade if your package manager warns about it.
:::

## Setup

To set up AssetPack, you need to create a configuration file that defines what assets you want to optimise and how you want to optimise them.

### For Node.js Versions < 20.19.0
First create a `.assetpack.js` file in the root of your project. This file should export an object with the following properties:

```js
// .assetpack.js
export default {
    entry: './raw-assets',
    output: './public/assets',
    pipes: [],
};
```

### For Node.js Versions >= 20.19.0

First create a `.assetpack.cjs` file in the root of your project. This file should export an object with the following properties:

```js
// .assetpack.cjs
module.exports = {
    entry: './raw-assets',
    output: './public/assets',
    pipes: [],
};
```

You will need to update in the config path to your `package.json` scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "assetpack": "assetpack --config .assetpack.cjs"
  }
}
```

To see the full list of configuration options, see the [API Reference](/docs/guide/configuration) page.

Then to run AssetPack, you can use the CLI, run programatically, or use a build tool like Vite.

- [CLI](/docs/guide/getting-started/cli)
- [Programmatic](/docs/guide/getting-started/programmatic)
- [Vite](/docs/guide/getting-started/vite)

AssetPack has a number of built-in plugins for you to use, to see the full list of plugins, see the [Plugins](/docs/guide/pipes/overview) page.

### PixiJS Setup

If you are using AssetPack with PixiJS, you can use the `pixiPipes` function to add a pre-configured set of plugins, with an opinionated set of defaults for PixiJS.

```js
// .assetpack.js
import { pixiPipes } from '@assetpack/core/pixi';

export default {
    entry: './raw-assets',
    output: './public/assets',
    pipes: [
        ...pixiPipes({
            // PixiJS configuration options
        }),
    ],
};
```

To see how to configure the PixiJS pipes, see the [PixiJS Configuration](/docs/guide/getting-started/pixi) page.

## Why AssetPack?

AssetPack was designed to solve the problem of having assets come in many different formats, and having to convert them into a format that is suitable for your game.
For example, you might have been given an audio file, e.g. `music.wav`, to be put in your game, but to get the best coverage across browsers, you need to convert it
into an `ogg` and `mp3` file. AssetPack can do this for you, and you can even compress the audio file to reduce the size of the file.

AssetPack can also be used to combine multiple images into a single sprite sheet, or to generate multiple sizes of an image. This can be useful if you want
to support different screen sizes, or if you want to reduce the number of HTTP requests your game makes.
